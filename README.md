# IMS & POS System

A comprehensive, local-first **Inventory Management and Point of Sale (POS)** system built with React, TypeScript, and Dexie.js. This application is designed to be offline-capable, secure via client-side encryption, and fully responsive.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Local-First Architecture:** All data is stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js).
*   **Client-Side Encryption:** Sensitive business data (profit, cost prices, customer details) is encrypted using the Web Crypto API (AES-GCM) before being saved to the database.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Auth:** The application derives encryption keys from your password. If the password is lost, data cannot be recovered without the **Recovery Key**.
*   **Offline Capable:** Works without an internet connection using Service Workers.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for tablets and desktop environments.

## 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

This project follows an **Agile and Iterative** development model.

### Methodologies Used
1.  **Agile:** The project is designed to be flexible and adaptive. Features are decoupled (e.g., Procurement is separate from POS), allowing for independent updates and maintenance.
2.  **Iterative Model:** The application was built in cycles:
    *   **Iteration 1 (MVP):** Core POS functionality, basic product management, and local storage.
    *   **Iteration 2 (Security):** Implementation of Web Crypto API for zero-knowledge encryption of sensitive fields (Cost Price, Customer Data).
    *   **Iteration 3 (Features):** Addition of Reports, Analysis, and Procurement modules.
    *   **Iteration 4 (Refinement):** UI/UX polish, Dark Mode, and performance optimizations (Virtualization/Pagination).

## 🐞 Testing & Debugging

### Testing Strategy
Since this is a frontend-heavy application relying on complex state and IndexedDB interactions, testing is primarily **Manual and Scenario-based**:
1.  **Unit Logic:** Critical calculations (Tax, Profit, Cart Totals) are verified against expected mathematical outcomes.
2.  **Integration Flows:**
    *   *Sale Flow:* Create Product -> Open Shift -> Add to Cart -> Pay -> Check Receipt -> Check Stock deduction -> Check Shift Cash update.
    *   *Return Flow:* Find Receipt -> Select Item -> Process Return -> Check Stock increment.
3.  **Cross-Browser:** Verified on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (iOS/MacOS) to ensure IndexedDB compatibility.

### Debugging
*   **Console Logging:** Extensive logging is used in the `SyncService` and `AuthContext` to track data flow and encryption status.
*   **DevTools:**
    *   **Application Tab:** Used to inspect IndexedDB (`IMS_POS_DB`) tables directly.
    *   **Network Tab:** Monitors Service Worker caching and Sync API calls.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **State Management:** React Context API + Custom Hooks
